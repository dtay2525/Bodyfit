			<p><strong><p style="font-size:160% ;"><h2 style="text-align:center;">Overview</h2></p></strong>
			<p><p style="font-size: 160%;">The <strong>XJS500</strong> is an upgrade to the previous <strong>XKS300</strong> model, featuring a new resistence-band sytem
			that users will find easy to use. Designed for both serious fitness buffs and beginners, the
			<strong>XJS500</strong> provides easy setup and storage with built-in holsters for extra bands and bars.
			the <strong>XJS500</strong> is designed for all users at any stage of their fitness needs. The resistance 
			bands range from 5 lb. to 25 lb.  Additional bands can be purchased as necessary.
			The <strong>XJS500</strong> is safe and easy to use and can be used alone or with a partner. The locking points
			prevent the bar from moving outside the normal range of motion. Since there are no heavy plates,
			you don't have to worry about dropping anything that could damage your floor. The resistance
			bands are made of sturdy, hard rubber rated for the resistance marked on each side.</p>
